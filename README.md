**Multi-User Messaging Application in C**
This project implements a multi-user messaging application in C without a graphical user interface (GUI). 
It consists of two programs: server.c and client.c, which run independently on the server-side and client-side respectively.

**System Details**
Server-side Program (server.c):
Listens to clients continuously.
Delivers messages to corresponding users.
Stores the user list of each client.

Client-side Program (client.c):
Users can:
Display their contact list.
Add/delete a user to/from contact list.
Check messages.
Write a message and send it to users within the contact list.
Receive and read messages.
Display message history of each user within the contact list (ordered by date ascending).
